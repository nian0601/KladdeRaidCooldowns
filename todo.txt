TODO:
- Groups grow weirdly. Ideal setup: You place the group-heading, and then that never moves, spells just grow downwards
- Add menu where we can select either specc, or available spells for each raidmember. This also needs to be persisted
- Add "Extra Information" that I added in old addon. Target of spell and Aura for Aura Mastery
- Add PallyAura-tracker that old addon has
- Add Deterance
- Fix raid-update bug. CDs wont recheck for availability until someone moves ppl in the grp. Atleast make it check once when joining. But there is no event for this, so need to do a "WasInRaid~=IsInRaid" thingy


Version 1.0

Groups:
- Can create any number of groups and assign spells to them, spells can be either "Show On Cd" or "Show Always"
- Can move groups around and the position is persisted
- Groups grow down, kindof, its weird, they also grow up sometimes?? Needs to be fixed

Spells:
- Almost all spells that we care about are tracked, need to add deterance
- All spells have short-names
- We dont do any specc-checks, because blizzard wont let us. The plan is to add a menu where we manually can set specc, or available spells, per raid member (this should also be persisted)
- We dont properly track GuardianSpirit
- There is no "extra information" (target of spell, aura for Aura Mastery), needs to be added
