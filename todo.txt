TODO:
- Need some way of determining which specc raidmembers have
	- Either use gladius way of autodetecting
	- Or add a menu where you can select the specc for each raidmember
- Add white/black-listing option for each group, so we can choose which raidmembers or speccs appear in each group
- Add Deterance
- Add setting for making the groups grow upwards
- Make unlock be persisted
- Add "Extra Information" that I added in old addon. Target of spell and Aura for Aura Mastery
- Add PallyAura-tracker that old addon has

Version 1.1
- Groups now grow down from the label, should be no more wierdness with it growing up sometimes
- RaidScanning now properly works, every 10s we'll scan


Version 1.0
- Can create any number of groups and assign spells to them, spells can be either "Show On Cd" or "Show Always"
- Can move groups around and the position is persisted
- Groups grow down, kindof, its weird, they also grow up sometimes?? Needs to be fixed
- Almost all spells that we care about are tracked, need to add deterance
- All spells have short-names
- We dont do any specc-checks, because blizzard wont let us. The plan is to add a menu where we manually can set specc, or available spells, per raid member (this should also be persisted)
- We dont properly track GuardianSpirit
- There is no "extra information" (target of spell, aura for Aura Mastery), needs to be added
