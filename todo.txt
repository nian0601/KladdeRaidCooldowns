TODO:
- Add druid-enrage as tankcd
- Add "Extra Information" that I added in old addon. Target of spell and Aura for Aura Mastery
- Add PallyAura-tracker that old addon has
- Add small spacing between spells
- Fix spell-sorting. Class -> Spell -> CD


Version 1.3
- We can now assign speccs to all raidmembers in a new menu in the config
- Each group can also filter on speccs for each class, Example: "Only show spells from Paladin Tanks"
- Removed extra space that appeared when the last bar of a group expired

Version 1.2
- Added Deterance and Readiness (readiness also resets all other hunter-cds)
- MD and Tricks cooldowns now get triggered correctly

Version 1.1
- Unlock now unlocks all groups instead of being per group
- Unlock is also persisted
- Groups now grow from the label, should be no more wierdness with it growing on both directions sometimes
- Added setting for growing bars upwards (downwards is default)
- RaidScanning now properly works, every 10s we'll scan


Version 1.0
- Can create any number of groups and assign spells to them, spells can be either "Show On Cd" or "Show Always"
- Can move groups around and the position is persisted
- Groups grow down, kindof, its weird, they also grow up sometimes?? Needs to be fixed
- Almost all spells that we care about are tracked, need to add deterance
- All spells have short-names
- We dont do any specc-checks, because blizzard wont let us. The plan is to add a menu where we manually can set specc, or available spells, per raid member (this should also be persisted)
- We dont properly track GuardianSpirit
- There is no "extra information" (target of spell, aura for Aura Mastery), needs to be added
